## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about developing software that not only solves business problems but also enhances user experiences and makes a meaningful impact on people's lives.

I am open to work with any stack that is needed, but my expertise is oriented to things like: Java, Kotlin, Spring/Quarkus, JUnit/Mockito, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Github Actions, AWS/GCP, REST APIs, Maven/Gradle.  
Other things I work or have worked with in the near past: Helm, Kafka, RabbitMQ, GCP Pub/Sub, Jenkins.  
I have also worked with these technologies, for a short time or far away in time: JS/JQuery, HTML, CSS, React Native, Soap, Golang, Groovy.

I thrive in teams with a devops mindset - we build it, we run it- and adapt Agile methodologies pragmatically, focusing on what truly adds value rather than blindly following guidelines.
